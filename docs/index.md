## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Synchronization**: Tracks watch status, progress, repeat counts, ratings, text reviews, and start/end dates.
- **Smart Content Mapping**: Matches Plex content (movies, shows, specials, etc.) to AniList using [a robust mappings database](https://github.com/eliasbenb/PlexAniBridge-Mappings) with fuzzy title search as a fallback and the ability to add custom media mappings.
- **Efficient Scanning**: Supports various modes of scanning like [partial](./configuration.md#full_scan), [full](./configuration.md#full_scan), or [polling](./configuration.md#polling_scan) scans to minimize API usage.
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Configurable [synchronization intervals](./configuration.md#sync_interval) in addition to polling capabilities.
- **Multi-User Support**: Sync multiple [Plex users](./configuration.md#plex_user) and home users with their respective [AniList users](./configuration.md#anilist_token).
- **Optimized Performance**: Intelligent caching of requests to minimize API rate limits.
- **Easy Deployment**: Fully compatible with [Docker deployments](./quick-start/docker.md) üê≥.
