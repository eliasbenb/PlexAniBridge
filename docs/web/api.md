# API

The API is self documenting via the OpenAPI specification. You can explore endpoints, view schemas, and try out requests directly from either the built-in [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) or [Redoc](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/) interfaces (available at `/docs` and `/redoc` respectively of your PlexAniBridge deployment).

Below is an embedded Redoc viewer for convenience. _Note: the embedded viewer may not always be up to date with the live API; for the most accurate docs, visit `/redoc` directly on your PlexAniBridge instance._

<redoc src="./openapi.json" />
